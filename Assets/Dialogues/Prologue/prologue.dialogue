[b]Moomoo[/b] was always [shake rate=20 level=10]violent[/shake]. But ever since his [i]ded[/i] disappeared, he's been uncontrollable.

You and ded left more than enough money for all the [b]Moomalians[/b] to get along, yet you've received worrying reports from the Moomalian High Council that Moomoo is creating [i]yet another[/i] dictatorship.

As their mother, you're left with no other choice. [wait=1]You must reunite the Moomalian family, locate Moomoo and tell him how disappointed ded would be in his behaviour.

[speed=0.3]And this time, you [b]will[/b] make sure he learns his lesson.
